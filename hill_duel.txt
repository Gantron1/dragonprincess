"Well," you say, "You've always presented such a strong image, so it was nice to see that you actually have a softer side. I didn't mean to laugh AT you, just that I was happy." It's not totally true, but it's partially true.

Tamara seems to relax a little but is still on guard. "I'll put my sword away if you do likewise," she says finally.

She moves her sword toward her shealth, sees that you aren't moving yours, so she stops. You move yours a little closer to your shealth, so she moves hers a little closer. Inch by inch, the two of you gradually ease your swords back into their shealths, all the time eye-balling each other warily.

Finally, the extreme silliness of it all becomes clear to both of you, and you laugh.

"Nay," Tamara says. "I would, but your request makes me suspect a trap."

"Then we are at an impasse," you say.

"Seems like," Tamara says, and the two of you continue to stare at each other, swords drawn.

Tamara glares at you. You glare back. It turns into a staring contest. The minutes tick by, neither of you giving ground.

Slowly, a grin begins to play at the corner of Tamara's lips, the utter stupidity of this battle of wills finally creeping into her consciousness. "Okay," she says, half-grinning, "I will move the tip of my sword one inch toward my scabbard. You do the same, and inch by inch, we will put our swords away."

She moves her sword tip and inch. You move yours an inch. She moves hers another inch, and slowly but surely, you both find that your swords are easing back into their shealths, all the while, the two of you eye-balling each other warily. Finally, Tamara bursts out laughing.

Good idea. You goad her, trying to make her angrier in order to make her more reckless. That was your intention, wasn't it? Not that you're just a big meanie?

Two can play the strategy game. You begin to circle her the same way she circled you to get the advantage, but Tamara moves to prevent you. With her greater agility, she manages to keep pace with you, and the two of you wind up maneuvering in a horizontal line across the hillside with you remaining just out of sword range downhill from her.

You cringe defensively, holding your sword over your head in a desperate bid to block a coming strike you're not truly ready for. 

Tamara, however, listens to your plea, and checks the downward movement of her sword, instead plowing her body into yours. Despite her smaller stature, because of your poor position, this bowls you over, and the two of you roll down the hill in a tight clinch.

She manages to get one hit in, which stuns you, but you're able to turn over and get on top of her. She still has her legs wrapped around you, restricting your movement, but because your arms are stronger, you're able to trap her arms beneath your weight. Before you can turn this to your advantage, however, Tamara thrusts with both her legs against your hips, freeing herself. She scrambles out from under you, and you're both on your feet again, except this time you have the hill advantage.

By running at an angle along the slope, you're able to reach Tamara with a slight height advantage, but after this attack, you will lose it. Tamara, running perpendicular to your charge, is forced to leave her right flank slightly vulnerable. She was smart enough to have run to her left, so now, her sword, being in her right hand, is on the side of her body that's facing you. She's holding it in a position where you don't yet know what she plans to do with it.

Tamara fights with discipline, raining blows upon you with deadly precision, never over-extending herself. You do your best to block but can mount only a feeble counterattack. Perhaps on level ground, the two of you would be evenly matched, but here, Tamara presses her advantage for all its worth. In a little while, you begin to tire, and she manages a solid blow to your forearm, making you nearly drop your sword. Blood gushes from the nasty gouge, and after the searing pain, your arm goes numb. You could fight on, but you doubt you'd win. Tamara backs off slightly, her attacks coming a bit less furiously, enabling you to still block.

	Tamara thrashes her head violently from side to side to escape your lips. "How dare you!" she cries. 
	
	Her fist bashes into the side of your head, and though she's unable to put her weight behind it, it does jar you a bit. You grip on her eases just enough for her to free her sword arm, but she has to let go of her sword to do so. She presses up on your chin, wrenching you head up and to one side, and with the fingers of her other hand, she goes for your eyes.

"I feel something growing between us," Tamara whispers, eyes closed, but a little sly grin on one side of her mouth.

"Is it love?" you ask, grinning.

"I think it's a little more cylindrical," Tamara laughs.

You push your hips forward rhythmically a few times and feel yourself grow even more.

"Don't stop," Tamara says, putting a hand on your tailbone and pulling toward herself.

"Yesssss...." she breathes, feeling you push your now fully hard member against her sex. Her legs entwine with yours, and she stretches her body.

You move your sword into position to stab, but just before you can, Tamara swipes the heel of your right foot out from under you with her still free, left hand. As you tumble down the hill, she manages to wrench her sword arm free from your grasp and stand.

Tamara kicks out with one of her feet and dashes your sword out of the way, but it still rakes against her leg, opening a nasty-looking gash. Her blow, however, comes full force and cracks your skull wide-open, powered by her descent and her rage in equal measure.

*label end5
Thus ends your quest, a meaningless duel because you mocked a woman in her moment of vulnerability. Perhaps someone knows the fate that befell Princess Elsbeth and Juliette the knight, but it's not you. At least not in this life.

You have reached Ending #5 of 5: Meaningless duel.

THE END
*page_break

Tamara's blow, powered by the downward force of gravity, is extra strong, but you still manage to block it. Uphill, with the advantage already, she allows you to get to your feet before continuing the duel.

*goto deadlyrain

*label spare
You know you're at an extreme disadvantage, so all that's left is to beg for mercy. You drop your sword and raise your hands in surrender.

Tamara checks her downward stroke at the last minute and lands on top of you, knocking the wind from your lungs. She puts her sword to your throat and sneers, "I should kill you right here!" She glares at you and fights the urge to kill you for a long moment before she finally calms. She gets off you, climbs the hill a ways and sits down.

You're only half on your feet when Tamara reaches you and never lets you regain your balance.

With your wounded leg, you're not quite fast enough. You do manage to get on top of Tamara and make her fall, but she kicks free, pulls herself up the hill, and stands once again.

A shadow passes overhead, momentarily darkening everything around you.

"By the gods!" Tamara cries in a panicked whisper. "You made me angry enough that the dragon has found us."

She quickly undoes her belt and pulls her breeches down to her ankles.

"Fuck me," she whispers urgently. "Now!"

*label dragonwhy
"Why?" you whisper back confusedly.

"We can hide from the dragon if we feel only positive emotions!" Tamara says, speaking quickly. "It obviously hasn't pinpointed our location because if it did, we'd be roasted by now. It's sensing our fear. Banish it from your mind by fucking me. Hurry!"

You rip off your pants but find your manhood unfortunately shrunken and unable to perform.

"Laugh!" Tamara commands. "Laugh at the irony of this situation. Remember, positive emotions only. Me, I like sucking dicks back to life. Not really, but today, yes. This is a happy day!"

She literally flies at your crotch and takes your flaccid little member into her mouth. You feel it flopping all around inside her as her tongue goes to work on it, and it just doesn't return to life.

"That's it. We're dead," you say apologetically.

Tamara looks up at you, your cock falling from her mouth. She inhales deeply, closes her eyes, and a profound relaxation moves over her body. She opens her eyes, and looking right into yours says, "I'm going to lick your cock like the inside of a ripe mango." (Ten points if you know where that's from.)

Slowly, without a care in the world, Tamara begins to run her tongue up and down your flaccid member, and she's so carefree that you relax too and get into it, forgetting for a moment there's a giant, fire-breathing lizard roaming the skies right above you. Your member grows again as long as you focus on Tamara, not the dragon.

When you're marginally hard again, Tamara pushes you down and climbs on top of you, pushing you inside of her even though she's not very wet. You feel your member pushing into her dry hole, and then she begins to bounce up and down furiously.

"Look at this!" she says and rips open her vest, her two breasts spilling forth and starting to bounce. It works. You aren't thinking about the dragon...

That is, until it makes another pass.
*page_break
"Oh, hmmm... must be a big bird going by," Tamara says. "That's not scary or anything. You feel so good inside me. It's good. No negative emotions I'm feeling at all!"

Soon, Tamara's inner walls wetten, and you're sliding in and out of her easily, as she continues to bounce up and down on you. Her breathing quickens as the pleasure fills her body, and she closes her eyes, concentrating only on that.

You hear a roaring sound coming from somewhere above, and the trees in a nearby part of the forest burst into flame.

"Ignore that," Tamara says, her voice strained from the sensations coursing in her body. A wave of heat reaches you, and Tamara says, "That's just the heat of our lust, nothing to worry about."
*page_break
She starts to move faster and faster. "Cover my mouth!" she cries. 

You quickly cover her mouth with one hand, and hold the back of her head with the other as she explodes into a violent orgasm that rocks her whole body. You feel her thrashing on top of you, and all your strength is barely enough to prevent her from ripping free of your grasp.

Finally, the spasms subside, and she lowers herself on top of you.

"I think the dragon's gone," she says, "And I came."

As if that wasn't obvious.

"You didn't finish, did you?" she says. "Impressive." 

Yeah, fear will do that to you.

She climbs off you. "We better get going," she says, pulling her breeches on, and you watch her luscious sex disappear again under her breeches. "The fire might head our way."

She picks up her sword and starts walking away, putting her breasts back in her vest and re-tying the strings.

"Are you coming?" she asks.

You wish.

"Look," she says. "We really gotta get going, and well, this was just a one time thing. It was just to save us from the dragon, and we need to maintain a professional relationship. Save the lust you're feeling now for the princess. Yes? Now come on!"

She walks away.
