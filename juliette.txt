	Tamara wakes you up just before dawn by nudging you in the ribs.

	"Hey," she says. "I'm going to prove I'm not a wishy-washy woman today. You just watch."

	She gets up and dresses purposefully, looking for all the world like a great warrior at the dawn before battle... and she is.

	"I know you're not," you says. "You don't have to prove anything to me. I know you're a master thief and strategist, a peerless fighter."

"State your business, cretin," she demands, but already she's advancing on you.

Tamara shows herself, causing Juliette to cease her advance.

"Nay, nay," Tamara protests. "It's just that my compatriot is a bit slow. Dull, really. Perhaps he thought it best to gently touch you to awaken you, or maybe he thought you might like male company at this time of day."

"Slow? Dull?" Juliette says, eying you appraisingly. "He doesn't look so retarded."

"Is it not the biggest you've seen?" you say, waggling it proudly.

"Actually, it is," Juliette sniffs. "But my experience is limited, you see, for I happen to be a lesbian, full monosexual${monosexual_asterisk}. Your vulgarity proves my initial impressions, and I trust you will seek no further intercourse. Good bye."

Once out of sword range, Juliette places her shield on her back and picks up what looks like an extraordinarily heavy, but finely wrought, dragonlance. Hefting it onto her shoulder, she turns to go.

You put your member back in your pants, wondering why it didn't work. It always seems to for John Leslie!

"Who's there!" Juliette cries, hand whipping to the pommel of her sword.

Tamara appears, purposely treading noisily, and Juliette glances at you, eyes narrowed suspiciously.

"Is this an ambush then?" she asks, backing away to keep the both of you in her field of vision.

"No, no, not at all," Tamara hastens to say. "We just thought the approach of one less threatening than the approach of two, but when I heard you say you must undertake your business alone, I couldn't help but question such sheer stupidity. Are you mad, woman?"

"I meant no insult," Juliette replies calmly. "If one was inadvertently given, I apologize. Also, I misspoke, for even if you both were knights, I would still deny your company, for my dragonquest I must undertake alone."

"Well, you have an old injury just above your left knee. Here, let me show you," Tamara says and crouches, scanning the ground before her. "Okay, see this footprint here?"

Juliette, still wary, nevertheless crouches with Tamara and listens as Tamara describes the meaning of all the characteristics of a footprint so faint it hardly even exists, each little shift of weight from which an entire picture forms. It's incredible.

"So you lied about clairvoyance?" Juliette says, rising to her feet.

"He was just speaking nonsense," Tamara laughs. "Horniness will do that to a man. Aren't you glad we women don't have that problem?"

A smirk creeps across Juliette's lips.

"I suppose you're right," she says. "I can see the source of the misunderstanding clearly now."

She turns to you and says, "I appreciate your offer, but know that for a knight, decorum comes first. I will excuse your forwardness if you will excuse my accusations of perversion. I wonder if now we might not share a morning meal and bring a bit of civilization even here, in the shadow of DragonKeep?"

"I did witness it for myself once..." you reluctantly admit. "But! My tracker friend really can discern the most astonishing details from the tiniest sign."

She turns to go when suddenly Tamara appears from behind a tree.

"Hi, I'm the tracker friend," Tamara says, smiling friendly-like. "I was out scouting, just returned, and couldn't help but overhear your conversation."

"Then perhaps you heard your friend's proposal and admission, the former of which I found insultingly presumptuous, and the latter, horrifying. I don't know what the two of you are doing here, so close to DragonKeep, but I ask that you do not interfere with my quest."

"We offer aid, not interference," Tamara says.

She turns to go.

You want to say something but can't think of anything, realizing you just screwed up royally. She's a knight, for Aslan's sake! Joking and joshing might work with a bar wench, but nobles follow different rules.

"Well, that went well," she says. "Here I was expecting a fun sex show, but instead I got an even more entertaining comedy of epic proportions."

"Did you see that lance of hers?" Tamara says excitedly. "I need to go ask her about it."

"Hey, Juliette," Tamara says. "I see I may not eat like a knight, and I don't fight like one either. Lemme ask ya somethin'. Why you knights always fight in a big line? You lose maneuverability that way... not that you have much to begin with, wearing heavy armor and all. Don't you feel clumsy? Why remove such an important advantage, that of mobility?"

"It's called a phalanx," Juliette sniffs. "A group of knights in formation is stronger than the sum of them as individuals."

"Well, I was a street urchin in the capital city of Mog, far to the east of here, and I was fourteen when I was kidnapped and sold into slavery. I was bought by the sultan of Bil-afrren, one of the kingdoms of the Great Dunes, and it was in his harem that I learned many of my skills. At seventeen, I escaped to the border kingdom, Unitzifar, gateway between the two great human cultures, Sand and Snow. My sword, hybrid between Sandy scimitar and Snowy long sword, was won as the prize of a duel to the death with my elder classmate, Zorlal the Cunning. Our master, the great Zoldan, taught me the hybrid art of the hybrid sword, superior to both Sand and Snow styles.

"When I returned to Mog, I reunited with the remaining urchins of my youth, now fully grown, and made my name as pirate, mercenary, spy, assassin, rogue, highwaywoman, and master thief. My reputation proceeded me, the guild found me, and today, I serve the chapter here in Zhang until the winds shift and take me elsewhere.

It told too of the dragoneye, and a commentary in the margin revealed its present location, at least until which it was acquired by me.

It has the power to heal, to charm, and polymorph if the proper method of its use is known. It can also be used for torture and even kill, and two generations of the Rivex line used it again and again in all its insidious functions until, to seal the peace with the three kingdoms, its use was outlawed. It sat gathering dust in the great vault of Castle Whiterock, fortress of the great-grand-niece of Rivex himself, until I was able to achieve its liberation.

"It was with this potion that I healed you, and the method of its function is sexual. Only upon the orgasmic release of the subject is power lent to the spell, so in short, I dosed you with the potion and used my mouth on you." Tamara laughs. "Too bad you weren't awake to enjoy it.

"You met my Banes?" Juliette asks, surprised. "How is he?"

"He is fine," Tamara says. "He will meet us at Chardell, and we told him we would offer our services to you. Would you like to join forces with us?"

You reveal to Juliette how Tamara is a tracker who read her tracks and how you met Banes who verified her morning ritual, and yes, you were re-enacting it but meant no insult.

Juliette stands listening, extremely red-faced. 

"C-carry on, then," she manages, now turning ashen and turning to go. 

Tamara smacks herself on the forehead. "You don't have to be a guild-trained thief to know honesty is not always the best policy," she says. "Let me see if I can salvage this."

She catches up to Juliette and says, "Please forgive my compatriot. He is sometimes honest to a fault, but perhaps a knight like yourself can appreciate the honor in that in the general sense? In any event, it was Banes' wish we aid you in your quest. I propose an alliance. Do you accept?"

"Weeelll," you begin, not realizing that this is not the most auspicious way to initiate a masterful lie. "My girlfriend, Tamara, here has a fetish for horses, so every morning, I pretend to be her stallion, Manes, you know, because horses have manes, so that's what she named me. I then neigh and gallop over to her and pretend that she's my feeding trough. That's why she half-sits/half-leans against a boulder--to imitate a trough of horse food. I then go over to her, eat my fill, and that's my breakfast. Then she rides me around for a bit, but we had no idea you were nearby or I'm sure we'd have skipped our morning fantasy fun ritual."

You look at Juliette hoping she buys it.

"That story is too outlandish to be a falsehood," she says finally. "Thus, I am inclined to believe it despite its very outlandishness."

"Sorry, sir," Juliette says. "Unlike your girlfriend, I have no fetish for horses, but if I did, I would prefer other mares, if you understand my symbolism."

"Wait, what?" Tamara asks.

"I'm a lesbian," Juliette says curtly. "Good day. I shall leave you to your feeding."

*comment add true monosexual part here. Make gosub for it, maybe even own scene in case the footnote might appear in a different scene. Ah, or leave it as is, but in morning_alone->lesbian, put a monosexuality explanation later.

There is a bit of an awkward silence before Juliette, a knight trained in diplomacy as much as swordplay, says, "Well, I am sorry to have disturbed you, but now that I have, perhaps you would care to join me in breakfast? Even here, in the wilds, we can, after all, enjoy civilized behavior."

You and Tamara look at each other, then nod.

"Good," Juliette smiles and leads you back to her camp.

"No! It's actually a great idea!" Tamara says excitedly. "She might come to investigate and see how good you are at cunnilingus, and one thing will lead to another, and I'll have done your job for you."

"Like your sugar," Tamara explains, speaking very slowly and enunciating each word like she's talking to a very slow learning child, "Any 'jobs' you receive come from Juliette now. I wish I had a knight of my own to seduce, but I don't, so can you please do a 'job' on me right the heck now??? It might be my last one!!!"

		"True," Tamara laughs. "I actually am very horny right now and want my last sugar, but I guess it's a good thing you save that for Juliette."
		
		"Save what for me?" says a voice.
		
		You and Tamara quickly turn and see Juliette in all her finery.

"Shhh! I hear something," Tamara whispers, and you heard it too. It's Juliette stirring.

"Time to make your move," Tamara says. "I'll wait here while you go apply your fantastic seduction skills!"

*label logictrap
You walk for half-an-hour, all the while Tamara serious and warrior-like.

Finally, she turns.

"Okay, apprentice, now that the wishy-washy woman stuff is behind us, there's this other thing we need to talk about--the disrespect."

"I was just kidding!" you protest. "I would have even given you head if you weren't so preoccupied!"

"Really?" Tamara says and her eyes take on a far-away look. 

She shakes it off.

"Well, that's neither here nor there," she says. "Even if you were joking, it was too much like disrespect, so I need to emphasize that we are back to a purely master-apprentice relationship now. Don't let the sex go to your head. It'll never happen again, and I think we need to put in place some extreme measures to ensure you respect never flags again. How about if you ever disrespect me, even just a little, you become my personal slave?"

Tamara's mouth falls open, and her eyes bug out.

"I AM wishy-washy..." she mutters.

She stares at the ground for a long while.

"No, NO!" she cries. "No, I was horny the whole time. That's not wishy-washy. It's a tactial reconsideration. I didn't know I would need sugar so badly right now, and it's fine because soon, apprentice will be engaged in Juliette's seduction."

She nods, having worked out a proper solution.

"Give me some sugar," she says, looking you straight in the eye.

"NOW!" Tamara cries.

She certainly does NOT seem wishy-washy!
