You eventually lose sight of her, but in a few moments, you hear her (all too familiar) voice from somewhere up ahead. It seems she's talking to someone, and it's not you for a change.
	
Climbing for a few more minutes, you see Tamara again, and she's talking with the manservant of the female knight. He introduces himself as Banes, and you learn that the knight, named Juliette, has left him here because he was too frail to continue the journey. He's obviously distraught at this, and they loved each other very much.

"Hail to thee!" you call. "May we approach?"

The old man's head jerks up, and he struggles to his feet as fast as he can, needing to brace one hand against the rock he was sitting on.

"Yes, yes, of course, stranger!" he calls back. "Welcome!"

Shaking her head, Tamara begins the hike toward the old man ahead of you, and as it's some distance, she makes the introductions along the way, announcing your quest to assault the dragon's lair.

You see the old man wipe his eyes, and he forces an overly friendly demeanor to hide his grief. "My name is Banes," he says. "Manservant to the knight-errant, Juliette, who has continued on..." 

It's pitifully obvious what happened. When the slope of the foothills increased, the old man simply could not go on. In fact, it's a wonder he's made it as far as he has.

From your new vantage point, you're able to see the old man, as well as enjoy being so close to Tamara's hot body. Literally. You can feel the heat emanating from it in waves of hot, moist air, and you can even smell her sweat. You sense her breathing, still a bit heavily from the climb, her breasts rising and falling so near to you.

Tearing your attention away from Tamara, you focus on the old man. He's sitting on a boulder, eyes cast downward, apparently doing nothing. The knight is nowhere to be seen, and nothing seems amiss.

Wow. Tamara being polite. That's a first.

Banes can no longer control his tears, and his voice breaks. "Her... quest... is similar... to yours..." he manages through his sobs. "I'm sorry," he says. "It's just that I've known her since she was born, and I so wanted to be with her in her moment of glory."

"Or death," Tamara says, and Banes' tear-filled eyes widen in astonishment.

"How can you say such a thing?" Banes says.

"You would do that?" Banes says, hope returning to his features.

"Yes," Tamara says, "If she will accept it. Knights are very proud, aren't they?"

"That is true," Banes says, easing himself back down onto the rock, a pensive look on his face.

"Well, we are off," Tamara says. "Good luck, old man."

"Oh, I tried to talk her out of it," Banes says. "But she would hear none of it. When she gets an idea in her head, there's no stopping her, and her skill in arms has always been enough to carry her through, despite her stubbornness. I think she's doing it because of her brother. She's one of the best knights in the kingdom, but she was unfortunate enough to have been born the little sister of a truly gifted warrior. She's lived in his shadow her whole life, and I believe she became a knight-errant to try and get out from under it, traveling the countryside, engaged in noble deeds, rather than the stuffy affairs of court. Still, it gnawed at her, and when she heard the dragon assaulted the castle, she vowed to kill it. 'To fight the unbeatable foe,' was how she put it, 'for honor in either glory or death.'"

"Oh, I'll be fine," Banes says. "I have enough food, and I'll wind my way down, back to Chardell. I'll wait there for you."

"Make friends with her," Banes offers. "She seems strong and aloof on the surface, but don't let that put you off. Underneath..."

He bursts into tears again and speaks through the sobs wracking his body. "She..." he manages. "has a heart... of gold!"

Tamara, who was already walking ahead, turns around. "Are there any other body parts of hers that might help us reach that heart of gold, old man?" she asks suggestively.

Once again, Banes' eyes open wide in shock.

"Like I said before, this is not the time for modesty," Tamara says. "Do you know something or not?"

Banes seems reluctant to engage in such a lewd subject, so Tamara continues. "Look," she says. "I'm a master tracker. I've seen all your sign and your tracks, and I know what goes on every morning. You had rabbit last night, and for two days, you've rationed your water. Juliette has an old injury just above the left knee. You love each other deeply and never argue."

"How in the world could you know all that?" Banes cries, his face reddening.

"Easy," Tamara says. "You walk side by side a bit too close together for full freedom of movement. Only people who love each other do that for a whole journey, and it never wavered once. On a hard journey, especially with you slowing her down like you have, your spacing would have increased during testy times, but even that never happened. So anyway, with privacy already lost, you can tell us anything. It might save her life. Probably not, but if you really love her that much, I'm sure the small impropriety is worth it, no?"

Banes is silent a long time. "Yes, we did love each other..." he says quietly at last.

"Yes, yes, we know that," Tamara spats, getting impatient. "Now out with the juicy details or we can just move on with out them. Your choice."

"No, no, please don't leave," Banes quickly protests. "I'll tell you."

He inhales deeply, face very red, but with reluctance he finally speaks. "The... animal... passions..." he begins. The words are hard for him to say. "They're powerful in all of us but are especially so in Juliette.

Why else would she stoop to be with a tired old man like myself? I think of her as my own daughter, so it gave me no pleasure to do what we did. Her love for me was no more than as for a father figure either."

"Well, that explains why she never gave full rein to her passions then," Tamara says. "But it wasn't her who did the stooping." She laughs.

Banes turns red again but is mostly astonished once again at how much Tamara is able to discern merely from the nearly imperceptible signs they left behind.

"Well, so now we know. We'll sex her up. Thanks, old man," Tamara says and turns to go.

"Wait," Banes says. "There's one more thing, a little embarrassing detail..."

"Oh, I think I already know," Tamara says without turning around, her interest fading fast. "Is it THIS?" She spins around, forms the fingers of one hand into a "V" and lewdly darts her tongue between.

"Why yes!" Banes cries. "You can see THAT too, just from our sign?"

"Yah," Tamara says and is already walking off.

*label resume
"Goodbye, Banes," you say. "Until we meet again."

He smiles kindly and nods. "Take care of your firecracker of a girlfriend," he says. 

You look back just before he fades from view, and he's still sitting on the rock. He waves goodbye, and you return it, then turn to go.

"How touching," Tamara snorts. "Now, come on, save that mushy stuff for the girl-knight you have to seduce."

A few steps later, she turns and says, "And I'm not your girlfriend."
