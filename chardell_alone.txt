In a little while, the path descends into a small wooded valley, and at the bottom, you find a small clearing with a large stake in the center. This must be Chardell, the place where the annual sacrifice was made, and you realize with horror that over a hundred maidens were in turn chained to that stake to await the dragon. You wonder how many are still alive and of those, how many will let you boink them.

Some of the surrounding trees are charred, and the burned areas are higher up with the lower branches untouched. It's obviously from dragonfire, but why? 

"Sad, isn't it?" says a familiar voice behind you. 
*if tamara_spat 
	You groan. She's baaaaack!
	*goto sad

	You whirl for the second time today, and of course, it's Tamara again.

	"Are you following me?" you ask.

	"I thought you might be following me, and I see that I was right," you say.

*label following
"Oh, not following," she says. "Just that we're both going the same way."

You shrug.

"Yes, it is sad," you say, thinking again of all the maidens. It seems such a cruel tradition.

"Yeah," Tamara says. "A hundred and fifty chests of treasure, now just sitting up in DragonKeep doing nobody any good."

"You sentimental fool," Tamara snaps. "It could easily have been me being sacrificed, so yeah, I have thought about it. A lot, but you know what? In the end we all have to die sometime, some just sooner rather than later. These girls at least lived long enough to see the flowering of their womanhood, something not everyone does."

She walks up to the stake and spits.

"To hell with you, dragon!" she says. "And to hell with all the kings who fed you our daughters."

Tamara inspects one of the charred trees.

"This is old," she says. "It must've happened a hundred years ago. I guess people wised up after that."

"But what happened to cause it?" you ask. "Was the dragon displeased for some reason? Or perhaps it was from a battle as some would-be hero attempted to rescue that year's sacrifice?"

Tamara laughs. "More likely the battle was with a band of thieves after the treasure... and the girl too, I suppose."

"Not my fault I happen to catch up to you when you decide to waste time," you hear Tamara say as you're leaving the clearing.

Shaking your head, you go on, and though the path ended at Chardell, you know which direction to go even when the mountain range is hidden from view, for the only way forward is up. You know that climbing the foothills will eventually lead you to the base of the mountain, and from there, well, you'll figure it out.

You walk for a few minutes, look back, and see Tamara following along behind you.

"I'm not following you," she says. "We're just going in the same direction. That's all."

*choice
	#Tell her not to follow you or you'll attack.

	#Shrug and continue on.

*label threat
Really? Remember, the dragon can sense negative emotions around its lair (or so Tamara says). Even if she's wrong or lying, do you really want to risk injury? If you wind up fighting, even if you win, you might be injured and in worse shape for when you reach the dragon's lair.
*choice
	#You really threaten violence. Tamara needs to learn you're no one to be trifled with.
		*goto ultimatum
	#It's not worth it. Let her follow you. Maybe she will prove herself useful at some point.
		*goto tamarajoins

*label ultimatum
You put your hand on the pommel of your sword. "Keep following me and you'll be sorry," you say.

Tamara stops in her tracks. "Like I said..." she says.

A staring contest ensues. An impasse.

"Well?" Tamara says. "Go on then."

You take a step, look back, and Tamara hasn't moved.

You take another, and now you aren't sure. She might've taken a small step while you weren't looking.

You quickly walk a good distance, turn around, and though she's further back, almost lost among the trees, it looks like she did move forward some also.

You suppose this'll have to do.

You continue making your way up the rocky slope, making slow but steady progress, and each time you look behind you, Tamara is a little closer. Eventually she's hiking along beside you.

"You're just slower than me, so I caught up. That's all," she says, a bit breathlessly. You can't help but notice the sheen of a thin layer of sweat on her skin and her chest heaving while she breathes, pulling tight on her vest's laces--she's attractive when her lips aren't moving!  

The two of you continue up the slope together, and you estimate that you'll reach the mountain proper sometime tomorrow. You have a hard trek ahead of you today, but you're up to the task.

At a particularly steep point, Tamara grabs onto the trunk of a small tree and reaches back, offering you her hand to help hoist you over the steep part.

Tamara pulls hard and propels you over the steep part and several feet in front of her. The two of you laugh.

Later, Tamara says, "Well, I guess we're traveling together now, aren't we?"

For every second you waste here, that's another second she spends in the beast's clutches."
