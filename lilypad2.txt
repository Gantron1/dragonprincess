"You've been trying to lose me all day," Tamara suddenly turns and shouts. "Why are you following me now? I'm going to pee again, and I don't want to see you when I get back!"
	
Something is very odd. There's no way she should need to pee again so soon. Either the first time was a ruse, this time's a ruse, or both times were ruses for some reason.

You climb for about an hour, and Tamara's uncharacteristically quiet. At first, you didn't question it, just enjoyed the peacefulness of it, but eventually, you realize something's off. She seems distracted, steps carelessly, making more noise than usual, and sometimes she climbs slow enough that you actually overtake her for a short while.

Tamara stops and thinks a moment. 

"Wait here," she says. "I need to, you know, shake the dew from my lily pad again."

"Already?" you ask, not remembering her drinking a lot of water recently.

	"I saw something today I didn't think could exist," Tamara says. "I've tracked Banes and Juliette for over a week, and a tracker sees such intimate details that it's almost like getting into the mind and heart of the prey. They walk side by side a bit too close together for full freedom of movement, and only people who love each other do that for a whole journey. It never wavered once, and that's even more odd because it shows they never bickered. Never. I put all this out of my mind, but then seeing him today... It was too much.
	
"I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I've decided I'm going to help you and Juliette, not just with the secret entrance but your full quests, to the death if need be. I saw what she had with Banes, and I never thought a love like that could exist. I can't let it die."

She gazes at the peak of DragonKeep in the distance a moment, then locks eyes with you. "Will you let me help you?" she asks. "I will make you my apprentice and teach you all I know of dragonlore. Then, when we join forces with Juliette, nothing can stop us. Do you agree?"

"Well," you say, walking down to where she is. "You've always presented such a strong image, so it was nice to see that you actually have a softer side. I didn't mean to laugh AT you, just that I was happy." It's not totally true, but it's partially true.

Tamara sighs and puts her sword away.

Juliette will likely refuse me because I'm a thief, and because of it, I think I will die tomorrow. I need you. What more can I do to show you my sincerity? Perhaps..."

You can't stand it. Now that Tamara's offered you oral sex, your hormones are raging. "Tamara..." you say sheepishly, "I know what I just said, but now..."

"I know, I know," Tamara says. "You men are all alike. Take off your pants."

"Really?"

"Yes, I want to," she says.

You slip your pants down to your ankles, and the stone is cold on your naked buttocks.

*label kneels
Tamara kneels between your legs. 

"This doesn't make me your girlfriend," she says, looking up at you. "You're still my apprentice and have to do everything I say. Also, since we need to maintain a professional relationship, this is the LAST time anything like this will ever happen, so enjoy it." 

Then her mouth is upon you, moving up and down your rock-hard shaft. She makes long strokes in a slow, languid rhythm for a long, long time, her hands resting gently on each of your thighs. Slowly the pleasure builds in you, reaches a plateau, and just can't quite cross it. She keeps you in this maddening place for almost too long, but then...

*label deepthroat
*set deepthroat true
She slides her hands to your waist and pulls your hips toward her, pressing her face deep into your crotch. You feel your member push down and into her throat, and she holds it there a long time, her body making her try to swallow, causing her tongue and all the muscles to move in involuntary convusions. Her body stiffens as she strains to maintain this position as long as she can. Her fingernails dig into your flesh, but you hardly feel it for the incredible pleasure the convulsions of her throat are giving you. She pulls you into her even deeper, and you nearly explode but hold back. She starts rocking gently, her larynx moving over your glans again and again, your cock never leaving her throat. Her hands grasp wildly at you now as she reaches the limit of endurance, roving over both legs and back. 

"Nnnnggghhhh!" she cries out, choking, but still she keeps you inside her.

You explode at the same moment she can take no more, and as your seed shoots down her throat, her tongue thrashes wildly on your frenelum, taking you to even greater heights. Seed drips from her lips, and you continue to shoot it in her mouth as she moves her tongue up and down and all around your shaft.
*page_break
*achieve blow
Finally the spasms subside, but Tamara keeps her mouth glued to the side of your shaft, for there's still pleasure flowing in your body. Slowly, this subsides into a great relaxation, and Tamara's grip on your body relaxes too, her body sliding to the ground. She lays her head against your thigh and looks up at you for a tender moment. She kisses your inner thigh, licks your scrotum, and her tongue lingers upon it for a moment like she doesn't want the moment to end.

At long last, she pulls away, smiles up at you, and rises to her feet. She wipes some seed from her lips and licks her hand clean.

If there was any doubt of her sincerity before, it's all gone now.

"I'm sorry for how mean I've been to you," she says. "I drive away the people I like, but that ends as of now. You're still my apprentice, though, and still have to do everything I ask. That hasn't changed."

You stand as best you can, your member rock-hard in your pants and getting in the way. Tamara smiles mischievously as she urges you along, pushing on your shoulder, laughing as you can hardly walk.

"Come on, come on," she says and prances a little prance beside you to show you how easy it is.

She puts an arm around your shoulder and walks with you to make sure you don't stop, so you have no choice but to lurch along beside her, each step stimulating you greatly, though not in a good way.

The two of you walk a little ways like this before she shifts her arm from your shoulder to holding onto your belt to pull you along. You take a couple difficult steps. Her hand moves a little closer to your buckle as she continues to pull you along. You take a few more steps. She pushes her fingers a little way into your pants, but at the same time continues to pull you along. Your heart thrills at the thought that she might actually give you relief, and you hope it's not all just a big tease. She slips her thumb into your pants too, and pushes her hand down. You feel it slide next to your raging member, and you almost explode right then. She, however, just continues to pull you along.

"Undo your belt," she says nonchalantly, not even looking at you, still just gazing ahead in the direction she's pulling you. You feel her hand wrap around your member and have to clench your muscles hard to keep from exploding. 

You do as you're told, undoing your belt without a word. She lets you stop walking now and turns toward you. With her one free hand, she pulls your body against hers into a tight embrace and looks firmly into your eyes. 
*page_break
"I'm going to move down your body now," she says breathily, slowly, enunciating each word. "Then..." She pauses. "Then I'm going to take you into my mouth." She pauses again, still looking deep into your eyes. You can hardly breathe for the anticipation. "I'm going to swallow you..."

Still looking in your eyes, removing her hand from your pants, she slowly moves down your body just like she said she would until she's squatting before you, her knees spread wide. She pulls down your pants, and your member spills forth into the warm sunlight. 

"This doesn't make me your girlfriend," she says, looking up at you. "You're still my apprentice and have to do everything I say. Also, since we need to maintain a professional relationship, this is the LAST time anything like this will ever happen, so enjoy it." 

She'd spoken these words slowly, and she moved slowly after, her open mouth moving toward the head of your rock-hard member. Finally, it makes contact, sending a wave of warm bliss through your body. You relax and put a hand on the back of her head. She closes her eyes as she takes you in and out again and again, and as she does so, you feel her tongue roving about, up and down the full length of your shaft.

She gazes at the peak of DragonKeep in the distance a moment, then locks eyes with you. "For that, I'm willing to risk my life and die if need be. I can't believe I'm saying that. All my life, it's been kill or be killed. Friends are just people who fight at your side until they no longer have use for you, and so that's why I made the deal with you that I did.

For this reason, I now offer you my full aid. We will aid Juliette in her quest, which is the same as yours, and I promise, if need be, I will die for either one of you.

"It looks like it'll go out," she says, and you wish the fire in your pants would go out too. "And there goes the dragon." She points, and you see the drake small in the sky, returning to its roost on DragonKeep. "It worked! I didn't think it would, but we did it. We survived!"

She turns to you, regards you for a moment, then says, "You look like you need to walk it off. Come on."

The two of you walk for awhile.

"Here's Juliette's tracks again," Tamara says, pointing at the ground. She studies them a moment and says, "We ought to catch up with her tomorrow morning, right at her morning sex time. You need to save yourself for then anyway, so stop looking so glum. Really, it's for the best."

The two of you walk a few hours more, and finally, the exertion of climbing the hill burns off your frustrated sexual energy. Tamara, wisely stayed behind you the whole time.

"Do you want to know why I was crying before?" Tamara says, seeing that now you're once again able to think about something other than raping her.

You nod, glad to have something to take your mind off things.
