*temp wotam "the woman"
"Are you here to slay the dragon?" says a voice, making you whirl around in surprise.

Before you, you see yet another woman, and how she managed to get so close to you without your hearing is a mystery. 

*label startchoice

*label look
This woman is very different from the knight, for the knight was tall, perhaps close to six feet, and everything about her positively glittered. This woman stands perhaps five feet six inches, slender but muscular, and dressed in earth-tones, she looks as if she could easily fade into the underbrush and disappear. 

She's wearing tan, skin-tight leather breeches that do well to show off her figure. Her boots are knee-high, fashioned from expensive leather, and she seems to have a custom-made leather vest inlaid with an intricate pattern in silver and a beautiful deep red color. It must've cost a fortune, but it's also practical, affording more than a small amount of protection in battle.

Her breasts are a small, shapely pair, showing just a hint of cleavage in the vest's neckline. Her arms are bare, but she's wearing doe-skin gloves that go up to her elbows.

She has a backpack and belt pouch, and by her side is a slender, wicked-looking sword. A crossbow is draped over her back with quarrels at the ready.

Her hair's a deep reddish-brown and falls to her shoulders. Her eyes are a piercing green, and when she looks at you, her intensity makes you nervous. You don't know if she's going to snap at you or simply turn away in disdain.
*goto startchoice

*label handweapon
"Go ahead and draw," the woman says. "I could've killed you already." She taps the crossbow on her back.

"Besides," she goes on. "I'm not in sword range, so I shouldn't have to step back. This is normal talking range."

*label draw
As soon as you begin to draw, the woman leaps backwards into a back handspring that takes her even further out of range. She draws her weapon, a wicked-looking scimitar.

"I just wanted to talk, but if you want to fight, bring it," she says.

The woman stands her ground as you advance upon her and meets your attack sword to sword. You find that she's a skilled fighter, and though you're stronger and have the reach advantage, her speed makes her an even match for you. The duel could go either way.

"You're a better swordsman than you look," the woman laughs. "You might even be better than I am." She continues to fence with you, unconcerned.

"Shouldn't you be more worried?" you ask.

"I would be, except..." 

She makes an especially strong attack which puts you on the defensive for a split-second, and then she springs backwards.

"I'm a thief," she says, "Not a warrior. Sleep with one eye open tonight."

She bounds off into the forest, and you know you won't be able to catch her.

"The name's Tamara, by the way," her voice comes from somewhere beyond the veil of leaves, and then, silence. She's gone.

You hurry forward in the direction she ran, but there's no sign of her. It's like she just disappeared!

"Well, at least you have a rope, so you must know the climb is difficult. However, do you know that the dragon can hear each stroke of your hammer when you're pounding in your mountain-climbing stakes? Do you know how it's watching all the time, and even now, from so far away, through tons of rock, it can probably sense us to at least some extent?"

In the days following the dragon sighting, you attempted to garner aid, both in the form of companions and information, to help you on your quest, but very little was forthcoming. Everyone with whom you spoke told you were crazy, and almost none had any helpful information. A ranger told you about the mountain and the need for ropes to climb it, and though he taught you the rudiments of mountain climbing, he too attempted to dissuade you from your quest. So far, even the most skilled knights have not been able to best this particular dragon.

You heard it's a very old one, has roosted in DragonKeep for as long as anyone can remember, and over time, the kings learned that they could appease the dragon by offering it maidens, gold, and jewels. Each spring, a maiden and a large chest of treasure is brought to a special place for the dragon to collect, and this has reduced but not eliminated its depredations of the countryside.

Continue your reverie?

Because of this evil pact, the royal court felt secure, so it was a great horror when the dragon attacked the capital city itself, for that had not happened since the very first offering, 150 years ago.

It was surmised (by the sages who studied dragonlore) that the dragon was incensed by the audacity of the princess's high tower, a magnificent structure twice as tall as any ever built before. 

A tradition had developed in Zhan where the higher a lady's bower, the more desired she was purported to be, and thus all ladies, when the became of age, lived in the highest one their family could afford to build. The princesses had the highest of all, and the king, who loved this particular daughter to an unusually great extent, undertook the task of building an impossibly tall tower to match her peerless beauty--and in so doing, unintentionally brought about the greatest tragedy the kingdom had ever known.

Such is the price of arrogance... a warning that you too, it could be said, have not heeded.

They can sense magic, so if you're carrying any magic items, they will give you away once you're close. They can also sense our very emotions, but only the negative ones. Greed. Anger. Jealousy.

Speaking thusly, she raises a clenched fist mightily before her and gazes purposefully off into the distance in imitation of a knight in victory.

I can't have you alerting the dragon to our presence, so I propose we work together. I will get you in without the dragon knowing, but after that, you're on your own.
